**HTML / Content Injection Through returnUrl parameter at colormasters.apple.com**

# Description:
- HTML Injection is a technique used to take advantage of non-validated input to modify a web page presented by a web application to its users, this happens when the data doesn't get sanitized , the **ReturnUrl** parameter will take data and reflect it on web page without sanitization so the user can put html code in there and harm users, there is an possibility to gain cross site scripting however i was not able to do that.
