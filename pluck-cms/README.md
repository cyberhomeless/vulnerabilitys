#### Security issue : bypass CSRF

Checking the cms we see the add new page function:

![page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66825349/162668481-1becfbcf-384d-44a5-b7cb-4abbfb71a3af.png)

checking the code we see that the app checks if the requests that being made is from the same domain or not:

but how ever the requests dose not contain any anti csrf token, there for we can use GET http method for malicious act and we can remove the page that is exist by giving a link to admin, with this request.
